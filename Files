# how to open a file
f = open("name_of_file.txt","r") # we open in read mode which do not let us to change anything 
# here we can read file and loop over the lines of file which are all strings or characters 
for i in f:
  print(i) # we print each line of file
f.close() # here we close the file 

# another way 
with open("name_of_file.txt",'r') as f:   # that way we do not need to use f.close() 
  ...
  
# we can use 'w' to write in file and change things, 'a' to append in file and so on
