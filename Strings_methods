a = 'maren sajdaras'
print(a.capitalize()) # Only the first char is capitalize
print(a.count('m'))  # outputs the number of times 'm' is in string a
print(a.endswith('sajdaras')) # print true because string ends with sajdaras
print(a.find(maren)) # will print the index if the substring is found in string otherwise will print -1
print(a.index(maren)) # is the same as find but in that case it will raise an exception if it is not found
print(a.isalnum()) # will print False because it has an space 
print(a.isalpha()) # will print False because it has an space isalpha output True if and only stirng has only chars
print(a.isdigit()) # will return True if the string is only with numbers indeed
print(a.islower()) # will return True if all the chars are in lower
print(a.isupper()) # same as islower()
print(a.isspace()) # checks whether the string consists of whitespace

# important method 
# join method return a strng in which elements of sequence have been joined by str separator
print(' '.join(list(a))) # this will print a but with spaces between chars
print(len(a)) # return the length of the string
print(a.lower()) # return the string but everything is lowercase
